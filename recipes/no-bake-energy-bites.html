    <h2>An easy to make snack!</h2>
    <p>It can be difficult to have healthy, low cost snacks around the house - especially ones that taste delicious!
        These energy bites solve that problem, though. You can buy the oatmeal in bulk, and once prepared, they stay good in the fridge for up to a week.
        You can also add or remove ingredients to create different flavor profiles, based on what your family is craving!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup old-fashioned oats</li>
            <li>2/3 cup toasted shredded coconut
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup peanut butter, creamy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ground flaxseed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp chia seeds, optional</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir everything together.  Stir all ingredients together in a large mixing bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Chill. Cover the mixing bowl and chill in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours, or until the mixture is chilled.  (This will help the mixture stick together more easily.)</li>
        <li>Roll into balls.  Roll into mixture into 1-inch balls.</li>
        <li>Serve.  Then enjoy immediately!  Or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 3 months.
        </li>
    </ol>
